# MATLAB-AppDesigner-LTI-Analysis
"Analyse SLCI" is an application for analysis, performance evaluation, and control design of continuous-time linear time-invariant (LTI) systems, developed using the MATLAB App Designer.  The graphical interface includes:
1. System Input Panel: allows users to input the numerator and denominator coefficients and the system order.
2. Graph Display Area: displays various graphs, including time response, Bode plot, Nyquist plot, Black plot, and more.
3. Performance Analysis Panel: displays the transfer function, poles, stability margins, static error, and response time of the system.
4. Controller Design Panel: allows users to select and adjust a controller from various options (PI, PID, etc.) to improve system performance.
